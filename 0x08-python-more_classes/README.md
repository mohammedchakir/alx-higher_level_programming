Read or watch:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://python-course.eu/oop/class-instance-attributes.php)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](https://shipit.dev/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html)
